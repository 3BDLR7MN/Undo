### 1. `isCompleted(for:calendar:) -> Bool` Model Method
- **What it does**:
	Checks whether there is a completed log entry for the specified date.

- **Parameters**:
	- `date`: The date to check for completed logs.
	- `calendar`: The calendar to use for date comparison (defaults to user's current calendar, e.g., `Calendar.gregorian`).

- **Returns**:
	- `true` if a completed log exists for the given date, `false` otherwise.

- **Code**:
	```swift
	func isCompleted(for date: Date, calendar: Calendar = .current) -> Bool {
        // First check if logs array exists - if not, then no logs means not completed
        guard let logs = logs else { return false }
        
        // Iterate through all available logs
        for log in logs {
            // Check if this log's date is the same day as our target date
            let isSameDay = calendar.isDate(log.date, inSameDayAs: date)
            
            // If same day AND log is marked completed, we found what we need
            if isSameDay && log.isCompleted {
                return true
            }
        }
        
        // If we checked all logs and didn't find a matching completed one
        return false
    }

- **Key Insights**:
	- Manually comparing dates is error-prone due to:
		- Time zones
		- Daylight saving time
		- Different calendar systems
		- etc.
	- To handle all these edge cases correctly, we use the built-in `Calendar` instance.
	- The calendar comparison:
		- Ignores time components (hours, minutes, seconds)
		- Respects calendar settings (Time zone, locale, and calendar system)

### 2. `log(for:modelContext:calendar:) -> HabitLog` Model Method
- **What it does**:
	Retrieves or creates a `HabitLog` for the specified date associated with this habit.

- **Parameters**:
	- `date`: The target date for the log entry.
	- `context`: The model context (Passable into functions).
	- `calendar`: (Optional) Calendar for date comparison. Defaults to the user's current calendar.

- **Returns**:
	- An existing log if one exists for the specified date, otherwise a newly created log.

- **Key Insights**:
	- The function first checks for an existing log matching the date. If none exists, it creates a new log, inserts it into the database, and associates it with this habit.
	- Association between `HabitLog` and `Habit` is established through:
		- The new log's `habit` property points to self.
		- The log is appended to `self.logs`.

- **Code**:
	```swift
	func log(for date: Date, modelContext: ModelContext, calendar: Calendar = .current) -> HabitLog {
        // Attempt to find an existing log for the requested date
        if let existingLog = logs?.first(where: { log in
            calendar.isDate(log.date, inSameDayAs: date)
        }) {
            return existingLog
        }
        
        // Create and configure a new log if none exists
        let newLog = HabitLog(date: date, habit: self)
        modelContext.insert(newLog)
        self.logs?.append(newLog)
        return newLog
    }

### 3. `getDayLetter` Static Function

-   **What it does**:
    Takes a `Date` object and returns a single, capitalized letter representing the first character of that day's abbreviated weekday name (e.g., "M" for Monday, "S" for Sunday). It relies on the `calendar` and `dateFormatter` available in the scope.

-   **Code**:
    ```swift
    static func getDayLetter(for date: Date) -> String {
        let weekdayIndex = calendar.component(.weekday, from: date) - 1 // Calendar.component(.weekday) is 1-7
        return dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[weekdayIndex].prefix(1).uppercased()
    }
    ```

-   **Breakdown**:

    | Component                                                  | Description                                                                                                                              | Example (assuming `date` is a Monday & `en_US` locale) | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `calendar.component(.weekday, from: date)`                 | Retrieves the weekday number for the given `date`. Typically, this is 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday in a Gregorian calendar. | If `date` is Monday, this returns `2`.                 | The exact numbering can depend on the `calendar`'s system, but 1-7 (Sun-Sat) is common.                                                                                                                                          |
    | **Index Adjustment** (`- 1`)                               | Converts the 1-based weekday number (1-7) into a 0-based array index (0-6).                                                              | `2 (Monday) - 1 â†’ 1`                                   | This is necessary because arrays like `shortWeekdaySymbols` are 0-indexed. Index `0` usually corresponds to Sunday, `1` to Monday, and so on, in many standard `DateFormatter` configurations (e.g., `en_US` locale).                |
    | `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[weekdayIndex]`          | Accesses an array of localized abbreviated weekday names (e.g., "Sun", "Mon", "Tue") using the calculated `weekdayIndex`.                   | `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[1]` returns `"Mon"`.  | `dateFormatter` must be configured (e.g., with a specific locale) or will use system defaults. The order of symbols (e.g., Sunday first or Monday first) in this array is critical for correctness and typically matches the 0-6 indexing. [LL#2](LearningLogs.md) |
    | `.prefix(1)`                                               | Extracts the first character from the retrieved short weekday string.                                                                    | `"Mon".prefix(1)` returns `"M"`.                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | `.uppercased()`                                            | Converts the extracted first character to its uppercase equivalent.                                                                      | `"M".uppercased()` returns `"M"`.                       | Ensures the output is a single, capitalized letter.                                                                                                                                                                              |

-   **Key Insights**:
    -   **Safety**: The calculation `calendar.component(.weekday, from: date) - 1` generally produces a valid index (0-6) for the `shortWeekdaySymbols` array, assuming `calendar.component(.weekday, ...)` returns a value between 1 and 7 and `shortWeekdaySymbols` contains 7 elements. This makes out-of-bounds errors unlikely under normal circumstances.
    -   **Dependencies**: The function relies on pre-existing `calendar` and `dateFormatter` instances. The behavior, especially regarding localization of weekday symbols, depends heavily on how these instances are configured (particularly the `locale` of the `dateFormatter`).
    -   **Localization**: The function uses `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols`, which provides localized names. This means "M" could come from "Monday" in English or "Lundi" (giving "L") in French, depending on the `dateFormatter`'s locale.
    -   **Uniqueness**: The function returns the *first letter*. In some languages, different weekdays might start with the same letter (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday both starting with "T" in English, Saturday and Sunday both starting with "S"). This function does not guarantee a unique letter for each day of the week if such conflicts exist in the `shortWeekdaySymbols` for the active locale.
    -   **Calendar System vs. `shortWeekdaySymbols` Order**: The `calendar.component(.weekday, ...)` provides a numerical representation of the day (e.g., 1 for Sunday). The `shortWeekdaySymbols` array is typically ordered (e.g., for US locale, index 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.). The subtraction of `1` correctly aligns these two if the calendar reports Sunday as 1 and the `shortWeekdaySymbols` array starts with Sunday at index 0. This alignment is standard for many locales like `en_US`.

### 4. `startOfWeek` Static Method

-   **What it does**:
    Calculates and returns the `Date` corresponding to the first day of the week that contains the given input `date`. The specific day considered the "first day of the week" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the `calendar` instance's `firstWeekday` property, which is often influenced by the user's locale settings.

-   **Code**:
    ```swift
    static func startOfWeek(for date: Date) -> Date {
        calendar.date(from: calendar.dateComponents([.yearForWeekOfYear, .weekOfYear], from: date))!
    }
    ```

-   **How It Works**:
    -   `calendar.dateComponents([.yearForWeekOfYear, .weekOfYear], from: date)`
        -   This part extracts two specific components from the input `date` using the provided `calendar` instance:
            -   `.yearForWeekOfYear`: The year to which the week number belongs. This is important for weeks that span across the boundary of a new year (e.g., the last week of December might partially be in the new year, or vice-versa).
            -   `.weekOfYear`: The ordinal number of the week within that specific year (e.g., 1 through 52 or 53).
        -   Example: If `date` is May 29, 2025 (a Thursday), and using a Gregorian calendar:
            -   `yearForWeekOfYear` would be `2025`.
            -   `weekOfYear` would be `22` (since May 29, 2025 falls into the 22nd week of that year).

    -   `calendar.date(from: ...)`
        -   This function takes the `DateComponents` (which now only contain `yearForWeekOfYear` and `weekOfYear`) and attempts to reconstruct a full `Date` object from them.
        -   When provided with only these week-based components, the `Calendar` interprets this as a request for the *start* of that specified week. The actual day (e.g., Sunday, Monday) that represents the start of the week is determined by the `calendar.firstWeekday` property (e.g., 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.).

    -   Force unwrapping (`!`)
        -   The `calendar.date(from:)` method returns an optional `Date?` because it's possible to provide `DateComponents` that don't form a valid date (e.g., month 13).
        -   In this specific scenario, because the `DateComponents` are derived directly from an existing, valid `date` by requesting its `.yearForWeekOfYear` and `.weekOfYear`, these components will always constitute a valid representation of a week. Therefore, `calendar.date(from:)` is expected to always successfully return a `Date`. The force unwrap (`!`) is used based on this assertion that the operation will not result in `nil`.

-   **Key Insights**:
    -   **Calendar Dependency**: The result is highly dependent on the `calendar` instance used, particularly its `firstWeekday` setting and its system (e.g., Gregorian, Islamic).
    -   **Locale Influence**: The `firstWeekday` is often determined by the user's current locale settings, meaning the "start of the week" can vary for different users.
    -   **Safety of Force Unwrap**: While force unwrapping is generally discouraged, it's considered safe here because the components used to reconstruct the date are directly and validly obtained from an existing date. A failure would imply a fundamental issue with the `Calendar` system or the input `date`'s integrity.
    -   **Time Components**: The resulting `Date` will typically be at the very beginning of that day (i.e., time components like hour, minute, second will be zeroed out or set to the start of the day according to the calendar and time zone).

### 5. `generateFullWeeksCovering` Static Method

  - **What it does**:
    Creates an array of `Date` objects that spans full weeks. The range starts from the first day of the week containing `startDate` and ends on the last day of the week containing `endDate`, ensuring all days within these bounding full weeks are included.

  - **Code**:

    ```swift
    static func generateFullWeeksCovering(from startDate: Date, to endDate: Date) -> [Date] {
        guard startDate <= endDate else { return [] }

        let startOfWeek = startOfWeek(for: startDate) (for:)
        let endOfWeek = endOfWeek(for: endDate)

        var dates = [Date]()
        var currentDate = startOfWeek

        while currentDate <= endOfWeek {
            dates.append(currentDate)
            guard let nextDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: currentDate) else {
                break // Should not happen with valid dates
            }
            currentDate = nextDate
        }

        return dates
    }
    ```

  - **Breakdown**:
    | Component                                                                                                | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `guard startDate <= endDate else { return [] }`                                                          | Ensures that the `startDate` is not after the `endDate`. If it is, an empty array is returned immediately, as a valid range cannot be formed.                                                                                                         |
    | `let startOfWeek = startOfWeek(for: startDate)`                                                          | Calculates the first day of the week (e.g., Sunday or Monday, depending on `calendar` settings and the `startOfWeek(for:)` implementation) that contains the input `startDate`.                                                                      |
    | `let endOfWeek = endOfWeek(for: endDate)`                                                                | Calculates the last day of the week (e.g., Saturday or Sunday, depending on `calendar` settings and the `endOfWeek(for:)` implementation) that contains the input `endDate`.                                                                          |
    | `var dates = [Date]()`                                                                                   | Initializes an empty mutable array named `dates` that will store the `Date` objects of the generated range.                                                                                                                                           |
    | `var currentDate = startOfWeek`                                                                          | Initializes a variable `currentDate` with `startOfWeek`. This `currentDate` will iterate from the beginning of the week containing `startDate`.                                                                                                       |
    | `while currentDate <= endOfWeek { ... }`                                                                 | A loop that continues as long as `currentDate` is less than or equal to `endOfWeek` (the last day of the week containing `endDate`).                                                                                                                   |
    | `dates.append(currentDate)`                                                                              | Adds the `currentDate` to the `dates` array.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | `guard let nextDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: currentDate) else { break }`           | Calculates the day immediately following `currentDate` using an accessible `calendar` instance. If this calculation fails (which is highly unlikely for valid dates and calendar operations), the loop is terminated to prevent errors.                |
    | `currentDate = nextDate`                                                                                 | Updates `currentDate` to be the `nextDate` for the subsequent iteration of the loop.                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | `return dates`                                                                                           | Returns the array populated with all dates from `startOfWeek` (the first day of the week containing `startDate`) to `endOfWeek` (the last day of the week containing `endDate`), inclusive.                                                        |

  - **Key Insights**:

      - **Order**: The returned array `dates` contains `Date` objects in chronological order, starting from the first day of the week of the `startDate` and ending with the last day of the week of the `endDate`.
      - **Range Coverage**: The function guarantees that the output array covers full weeks. This means it will always start on the first day of a week and end on the last day of a week, potentially including dates before the provided `startDate` (if `startDate` isn't the first day of its week) and after the `endDate` (if `endDate` isn't the last day of its week) to complete those boundary weeks.
      - **Calendar Dependency**: Relies heavily on an accessible `calendar` object (for adding days) and the behavior of helper functions `startOfWeek(for:)` and `endOfWeek(for:)`. These helpers, in turn, depend on the `calendar`'s settings (e.g., `firstWeekday`, locale) to determine the actual start and end days of a week.
      - **Edge Cases**:
          - If `startDate` is later than `endDate`, an empty array `[]` is returned.
          - If `startDate` and `endDate` are the same, the array will contain all days (e.g., 7 days) of the single week that includes this date.
          - If `startDate` and `endDate` fall within the same week, the array will similarly contain all days of that single week.
          - The `guard let nextDate = ...` provides robustness against potential (though rare) failures in date calculation.

### 6. `action` closure parameter
- **Type Requirement**:
	- `DayCompletionView` expects `action: () -> Void` (no parameters, no return):
		```swift
		struct DayCompletionView: View {
			let action: () -> Void
		}
    
    - But `toggleCompletion(for:)` requires a `Date` parameter and uses the `modelContext`:
		```swift
		func toggleCompletion(for date: Date) {
			let log = habit.log(for: date, modelContext: modelContext)
			log.isCompleted.toggle()
		}

- **How It Works**:
	The closure captures the current `weekDay` value from the `ForEach` iteration
    Creates a parameter-less closure that "remembers" its specific `day`

- **Execution Flow**:
	`Button Tap` â†’ Calls closure `()` â†’ Runs `toggleCompletion(for: capturedDay)`

- **Equivalent Swift Code**:
	```swift
	let action: () -> Void = { [day] in
    	self.toggleCompletion(for: day)
    }

### 7. Understanding @State Initialization in SwiftUI Initializers (`init`)

-  **What is `@State`?**
	- `@State` is a **property wrapper** in SwiftUI.
	- It allows a view to manage a piece of mutable state.
	- When a `@State` variable's value changes, SwiftUI automatically re-renders the parts of the view that depend on that state.
	- Behind the scenes, `@State` creates a managing struct (e.g., `State<ValueType>`) that holds and manages the actual value.

- **Example Declaration:**
	```swift
	struct MyView: View {
		@State private var counter: Int // Declared but not yet initialized with a value here
		private var initialCount: Int

		// Custom initializer
		init(initialCount: Int) {
			self.initialCount = initialCount
			// We need to initialize 'counter' here. How?
			// Correct way:
			self._counter = State(initialValue: initialCount)
		}

		var body: some View {
			Text("Count: \(counter)")
		}
	}
	```

- **Accessing the Wrapped Value vs. the Wrapper Itself**
	Swift provides two ways to interact with a property wrapper:

	- **`propertyName` (e.g., `self.counter`)**:
		- This refers to the **wrapped value** itself (e.g., the `Int` for `counter`).
		- This is what you typically use in your view's `body` or in methods *after* the view has been initialized.
		- SwiftUI provides syntactic sugar for this common case.

	- **`_propertyName` (e.g., `self._counter`)**:
		- This refers to the **property wrapper instance itself** (e.g., the `State<Int>` struct).
		- This is necessary when you need to interact directly with the wrapper's mechanics, particularly during initialization or when accessing projected values like `Binding`.

- **Why `self.propertyName = someValue` Doesn't Work for Initialization in `init`**
	Consider the line: `self.counter = initialCount` within the `init`.

	- **Problem**: This attempts to assign directly to the *wrapped value* (`Int`). However, during the `init` phase (if no default value was provided at declaration), the underlying `State<Int>` wrapper itself hasn't been properly initialized yet.
	- **Initialization Requirement**: All stored properties of a struct must be fully initialized before the `init` method completes. For `@State` properties, this means the `State<ValueType>` wrapper needs to be constructed and told what its initial managed value is.
	- Simply assigning to the wrapped value bypasses the explicit initialization of the `State` wrapper that SwiftUI expects in this scenario. It's like trying to use a managed resource before its manager is set up.

- **Why `self.propertyName = State(initialValue: someValue)` Doesn't Work**
	Consider the line: `self.counter = State(initialValue: initialCount)`.

	- **Problem**: This is a **type mismatch**.
		- `self.counter` (without the underscore) is expected to be of type `Int` (the wrapped value).
		- `State(initialValue: initialCount)` creates an instance of `State<Int>` (the wrapper struct).
	- You cannot assign an instance of `State<Int>` directly to a variable that is syntactically treated as an `Int`. The compiler will error out.

- **The Correct Approach: `self._propertyName = State(initialValue: someValue)`**
	This is the correct way to initialize a `@State` property within an `init` when its initial value is determined dynamically:

	```swift
	init(initialCount: Int) {
		self.initialCount = initialCount // Initializing a regular property
		self._counter = State(initialValue: initialCount) // Correctly initializing the @State property
	}
	```

	- **`self._counter`**: Accesses the actual `State<Int>` property wrapper instance.
	- **`State(initialValue: initialCount)`**: Creates a new instance of the `State<Int>` wrapper struct and sets its initial managed value to `initialCount`.
	- **`=`**: Assigns this newly created and configured `State<Int>` wrapper instance to the backing storage for the `counter` property.

- **Why this works:**

	-  **Correct Type**: You are assigning a `State<Int>` object to `self._counter`, which *is* the `State<Int>` wrapper.
	-  **Explicit Initialization**: This explicitly calls the initializer of the `State` struct, ensuring the property wrapper is set up correctly by SwiftUI with its initial state.
	-  **Lifecycle Compliance**: This satisfies Swift's requirement that all properties (including the backing storage for property wrappers) are initialized before `init` completes.

- **Summary**

	| Attempted Initialization in `init`            | Why it doesn't work (for `@State` without default value at declaration) |
	| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
	| `self.propertyName = someValue`             | Tries to set wrapped value before the `State` wrapper itself is initialized. |
	| `self.propertyName = State(initialValue: â€¦)` | Type mismatch: Assigning `State<Value>` to `Value`.                      |
	| **`self._propertyName = State(initialValue: â€¦)`** | **Correct**: Initializes the `State` wrapper itself with the initial value. |

### 8. TipKit Integration for In-App Guidance

- **What it does**:
    Provides a standardized, easy-to-use framework for displaying feature hints and guidance to users within the app. TipKit manages the logic for when and how often to show these tips, and SwiftUI provides simple view modifiers and components to display them.

- **Implementation Breakdown**:
    The integration of TipKit in the "Undo" app can be broken down into four key steps:

    -  **Defining the Tips**:
        -   First, we define the structure of each tip by creating a struct that conforms to the `Tip` protocol.
        -   Each tip must have a `title`, and can optionally include a `message` and an `image`.

        -   **Code (`Models/Tips.swift`)**:
            ```swift
            import Foundation
            import TipKit

            struct AddHabitTip: Tip {
                var title: Text {
                    Text("Add Your First Habit")
                }

                var message: Text? {
                    Text("Tap the plus button to create a new habit.")
                        .foregroundStyle(.gray)
                }
            }

            struct HabitContextMenuTip: Tip {
                var title: Text {
                    Text("Manage Your Habit")
                }

                var message: Text? {
                    Text("Long-press on a habit to see more options.")
                        .foregroundStyle(.gray)
                }

                var image: Image? {
                    Image(systemName: "hand.tap.fill")
                }
            }
            ```

    -  **Configuring the TipKit Environment**:
        -   At the app's launch, we need to configure the global settings for TipKit. This is done once.
        -   `Tips.configure()` sets up parameters like display frequency and where the TipKit data (like which tips have been seen) should be stored.

        -   **Code (`UndoApp.swift`)**:
            ```swift
            .task {
                try? Tips.configure([
                    .displayFrequency(.immediate),
                    .datastoreLocation(.applicationDefault)
                ])
            }
            ```

    -  **Displaying the Tips in the UI**:
        -   TipKit offers two primary ways to display tips in SwiftUI: as a popover or inline.
        -   **Popover**: The `.popoverTip()` modifier attaches a tip to a specific view. The tip appears as a popover pointing to that view. This is great for contextual hints tied to a button or UI element.
        -   **Inline View**: `TipView` is a dedicated SwiftUI view that displays the tip directly within the view hierarchy. This is useful for placing tips in a `List` or `VStack`.

        -   **Code Examples**:
            -   **Popover Style (`MyHabitsView.swift`)**:
                ```swift
                Button("Add Habit", systemImage: "plus") {
                    // ...
                }
                .popoverTip(addHabitTip, arrowEdge: .top)
                ```
            -   **Inline Style (`HabitsSectionView.swift`)**:
                ```swift
                LazyVStack(spacing: 12) {
                    TipView(habitContextMenuTip)
                    ForEach(habits) { habit in
                       // ...
                    }
                }
                ```

    -  **Controlling Tip Eligibility**:
        -   A crucial part of TipKit is managing when a tip should stop appearing. This is done by invalidating it.
        -   Calling `tip.invalidate(reason: .actionPerformed)` marks the tip as "seen" or "acted upon," preventing it from being shown again. This ensures that users are not repeatedly shown tips for features they have already used.

        -   **Code (`MyHabitsView.swift`)**:
            ```swift
            Button("Add Habit", systemImage: "plus") {
                let habit = Habit()
                path = [habit]
                addHabitTip.invalidate(reason: .actionPerformed)
            }
            ```

### 9. `requestAuthorization()` Model Method

  - **What it does**:
    Prompts the user with a standard iOS system alert, asking for their permission to allow the app to send them notifications. This is a critical first step for any feature involving local or remote notifications.

  - **Code**:
    ```swift
    func requestAuthorization() {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) { granted, error in
            if granted {
                print("Notification permission granted.")
            } else if let error = error {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  - **Breakdown**:
    | Component | Description |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | `UNUserNotificationCenter.current()` | Retrieves the shared `UNUserNotificationCenter` object for the app. This object is the central point for managing all notification-related activities. |
    | `.requestAuthorization(options:completionHandler:)` | This method initiates the permission request. It presents the system dialog to the user. This should always be called before scheduling any local notifications. |
    | `options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]` | An array of `UNAuthorizationOptions` that specifies the types of notifications the app would like to send. You must request authorization for each type of interaction you plan to use. |
    | `completionHandler: { granted, error in ... }` | An asynchronous block of code that is executed *after* the user responds to the permission prompt. <br> - `granted`: A `Bool` that is `true` if the user granted permission for at least one of the requested options, and `false` otherwise. <br> - `error`: An optional `Error` object that will contain a value if something went wrong with the authorization process itself. |

- **Key Insights**:
    - **One-Time Prompt**: The system only prompts the user the very first time this method is called. After the initial choice, subsequent calls will not show the dialog again and will instead use the user's stored preference.
    - **Context is Key**: It's best practice to call this function in a context that helps the user understand *why* your app needs to send them notifications. For example, when they first interact with a feature that uses reminders.
    - **Asynchronous Operation**: The `completionHandler` runs on a background thread, so you should be mindful of any UI updates you might want to perform, dispatching them back to the main thread if necessary.

---

### 10. `scheduleNotification(for:)` Model Method

- **What it does**:
    Schedules a local notification to be delivered daily at a specific time, based on the properties of a given `Reminder` object.
- **Code**:
    ```swift
    func scheduleNotification(for reminder: Reminder) {
        guard reminder.isEnabled else { return }

        let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
        content.title = "Habit Reminder"
        content.subtitle = reminder.getHabitName()
        content.sound = .default

        let dateComponents = DateUtils.calendar.dateComponents([.hour, .minute], from: reminder.time)
        let trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(dateMatching: dateComponents, repeats: true)

        let request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: reminder.id.uuidString, content: content, trigger: trigger)

        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
    }
    ```

- **Breakdown**:
    | Component | Explanation |
    | :--- | :--- |
    | `guard reminder.isEnabled else { return }` | A safety check that immediately stops the function if the user has disabled reminders for this habit, preventing unwanted notifications from being scheduled. |
    | `let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()` | Creates the payload of the notificationâ€”the actual content that the user will see and hear. |
    | `content.title = "Habit Reminder"` | Sets the main, bolded title of the notification alert. |
    | `content.subtitle = reminder.getHabitName()` | Sets the secondary text below the title, using the name of the habit for context. |
    | `content.sound = .default` | Specifies that the default system notification sound should be played when the alert is delivered. |
    | `let dateComponents = ...` | Extracts *only* the hour and minute from the `reminder.time`. By ignoring the day, month, and year, we can create a trigger that is time-based, not date-based. |
    | `let trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(...)` | Defines *when* the notification should fire. Because `dateMatching` only contains an hour and a minute, and `repeats` is `true`, the system will trigger this notification every day when the clock matches that time. |
    | `let request = UNNotificationRequest(...)` | Bundles the `content` (what to show) and the `trigger` (when to show it) into a single request. The `identifier` is set to the reminder's unique ID, which is crucial for being able to find and cancel this specific notification later. |
    | `UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)` | Submits the final request to the iOS system. The system now takes over and is responsible for delivering the notification at the scheduled time. |

- **Key Insights**:
    - **Prerequisites**: This function assumes that the user has already granted notification permissions via `requestAuthorization()`. If permission has not been granted, the system will silently discard the request.

---

### 11. `updateReminder(isEnabled:time:modelContext:)` Model Method

- **What it does**:
    Acts as the central controller for managing a habit's reminder. It handles the creation, updating, and deletion of a `Reminder` object and its corresponding scheduled notification based on user input.

- **Code**:
    ```swift
    func updateReminder(isEnabled: Bool, time: Date, modelContext: ModelContext) {
        if isEnabled {
            if let reminder = self.reminder {
                // Scenario: Update existing reminder
                reminder.time = time
                reminder.isEnabled = true
                NotificationManager.instance.scheduleNotification(for: reminder)
            } else {
                // Scenario: Create new reminder
                let newReminder = Reminder(isEnabled: true, time: time)
                self.reminder = newReminder
                NotificationManager.instance.scheduleNotification(for: newReminder)
            }
        } else {
            // Scenario: Disable/delete reminder
            if let reminder = self.reminder {
                NotificationManager.instance.unscheduleNotification(for: reminder)
                modelContext.delete(reminder)
                self.reminder = nil
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- **Parameters**:
    - `isEnabled`: A `Bool` that determines whether the reminder should be active.
    - `time`: A `Date` object representing the desired time for the notification to be delivered.
    - `modelContext`: The `ModelContext` required to save or delete the `Reminder` object from the SwiftData database.

- **Execution Flow**:
    The function's logic is split into two main paths based on the `isEnabled` parameter.

    -  **When `isEnabled` is `true` (Toggle is ON)**:
        The function first checks if a reminder already exists for the habit.

        - **If a reminder exists**: It updates the existing reminder's `time`. It then calls `NotificationManager.instance.scheduleNotification(for:)` to reschedule the notification with the new time. The `NotificationManager` automatically replaces the old pending notification because they share the same unique ID.
        - **If no reminder exists**: It creates a new `Reminder` object, associates it with the current habit, and then calls `NotificationManager.instance.scheduleNotification(for:)` to schedule a brand new daily notification.

    -  **When `isEnabled` is `false` (Toggle is OFF)**:
        The function checks if there is an existing reminder to remove.

        - If a reminder is found, it performs a three-step cleanup process:
            1.  **Unschedule**: It calls `NotificationManager.instance.unscheduleNotification(for:)` to remove the pending notification from the system, preventing future alerts.
            2.  **Delete**: It uses the `modelContext` to delete the `Reminder` object from the database.
            3.  **De-associate**: It sets the habit's `reminder` property to `nil` to ensure the app's state is consistent.
