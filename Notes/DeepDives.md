### 1. `isCompleted(for:calendar:) -> Bool` Model Method
- **What it does**:
	Checks whether there is a completed log entry for the specified date.

- **Parameters**:
	- `date`: The date to check for completed logs.
	- `calendar`: The calendar to use for date comparison (defaults to user's current calendar, e.g., `Calendar.gregorian`).

- **Returns**:
	- `true` if a completed log exists for the given date, `false` otherwise.

- **Code**:
	```swift
	func isCompleted(for date: Date, calendar: Calendar = .current) -> Bool {
        // First check if logs array exists - if not, then no logs means not completed
        guard let logs = logs else { return false }
        
        // Iterate through all available logs
        for log in logs {
            // Check if this log's date is the same day as our target date
            let isSameDay = calendar.isDate(log.date, inSameDayAs: date)
            
            // If same day AND log is marked completed, we found what we need
            if isSameDay && log.isCompleted {
                return true
            }
        }
        
        // If we checked all logs and didn't find a matching completed one
        return false
    }

- **Key Insights**:
	- Manually comparing dates is error-prone due to:
		- Time zones
		- Daylight saving time
		- Different calendar systems
		- etc.
	- To handle all these edge cases correctly, we use the built-in `Calendar` instance.
	- The calendar comparison:
		- Ignores time components (hours, minutes, seconds)
		- Respects calendar settings (Time zone, locale, and calendar system)

### 2. `log(for:modelContext:calendar:) -> HabitLog` Model Method
- **What it does**:
	Retrieves or creates a `HabitLog` for the specified date associated with this habit.

- **Parameters**:
	- `date`: The target date for the log entry.
	- `context`: The model context (Passable into functions).
	- `calendar`: (Optional) Calendar for date comparison. Defaults to the user's current calendar.

- **Returns**:
	- An existing log if one exists for the specified date, otherwise a newly created log.

- **Key Insights**:
	- The function first checks for an existing log matching the date. If none exists, it creates a new log, inserts it into the database, and associates it with this habit.
	- Association between `HabitLog` and `Habit` is established through:
		- The new log's `habit` property points to self.
		- The log is appended to `self.logs`.

- **Code**:
	```swift
	func log(for date: Date, modelContext: ModelContext, calendar: Calendar = .current) -> HabitLog {
        // Attempt to find an existing log for the requested date
        if let existingLog = logs?.first(where: { log in
            calendar.isDate(log.date, inSameDayAs: date)
        }) {
            return existingLog
        }
        
        // Create and configure a new log if none exists
        let newLog = HabitLog(date: date, habit: self)
        modelContext.insert(newLog)
        self.logs?.append(newLog)
        return newLog
    }

### 3. `getDayLetter` Static Function

-   **What it does**:
    Takes a `Date` object and returns a single, capitalized letter representing the first character of that day's abbreviated weekday name (e.g., "M" for Monday, "S" for Sunday). It relies on the `calendar` and `dateFormatter` available in the scope.

-   **Code**:
    ```swift
    static func getDayLetter(for date: Date) -> String {
        let weekdayIndex = calendar.component(.weekday, from: date) - 1 // Calendar.component(.weekday) is 1-7
        return dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[weekdayIndex].prefix(1).uppercased()
    }
    ```

-   **Breakdown**:

    | Component                                                  | Description                                                                                                                              | Example (assuming `date` is a Monday & `en_US` locale) | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `calendar.component(.weekday, from: date)`                 | Retrieves the weekday number for the given `date`. Typically, this is 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, ..., 7 for Saturday in a Gregorian calendar. | If `date` is Monday, this returns `2`.                 | The exact numbering can depend on the `calendar`'s system, but 1-7 (Sun-Sat) is common.                                                                                                                                          |
    | **Index Adjustment** (`- 1`)                               | Converts the 1-based weekday number (1-7) into a 0-based array index (0-6).                                                              | `2 (Monday) - 1 â†’ 1`                                   | This is necessary because arrays like `shortWeekdaySymbols` are 0-indexed. Index `0` usually corresponds to Sunday, `1` to Monday, and so on, in many standard `DateFormatter` configurations (e.g., `en_US` locale).                |
    | `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[weekdayIndex]`          | Accesses an array of localized abbreviated weekday names (e.g., "Sun", "Mon", "Tue") using the calculated `weekdayIndex`.                   | `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols[1]` returns `"Mon"`.  | `dateFormatter` must be configured (e.g., with a specific locale) or will use system defaults. The order of symbols (e.g., Sunday first or Monday first) in this array is critical for correctness and typically matches the 0-6 indexing. [LL#2](LearningLogs.md) |
    | `.prefix(1)`                                               | Extracts the first character from the retrieved short weekday string.                                                                    | `"Mon".prefix(1)` returns `"M"`.                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | `.uppercased()`                                            | Converts the extracted first character to its uppercase equivalent.                                                                      | `"M".uppercased()` returns `"M"`.                       | Ensures the output is a single, capitalized letter.                                                                                                                                                                              |

-   **Key Insights**:
    -   **Safety**: The calculation `calendar.component(.weekday, from: date) - 1` generally produces a valid index (0-6) for the `shortWeekdaySymbols` array, assuming `calendar.component(.weekday, ...)` returns a value between 1 and 7 and `shortWeekdaySymbols` contains 7 elements. This makes out-of-bounds errors unlikely under normal circumstances.
    -   **Dependencies**: The function relies on pre-existing `calendar` and `dateFormatter` instances. The behavior, especially regarding localization of weekday symbols, depends heavily on how these instances are configured (particularly the `locale` of the `dateFormatter`).
    -   **Localization**: The function uses `dateFormatter.shortWeekdaySymbols`, which provides localized names. This means "M" could come from "Monday" in English or "Lundi" (giving "L") in French, depending on the `dateFormatter`'s locale.
    -   **Uniqueness**: The function returns the *first letter*. In some languages, different weekdays might start with the same letter (e.g., Tuesday and Thursday both starting with "T" in English, Saturday and Sunday both starting with "S"). This function does not guarantee a unique letter for each day of the week if such conflicts exist in the `shortWeekdaySymbols` for the active locale.
    -   **Calendar System vs. `shortWeekdaySymbols` Order**: The `calendar.component(.weekday, ...)` provides a numerical representation of the day (e.g., 1 for Sunday). The `shortWeekdaySymbols` array is typically ordered (e.g., for US locale, index 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, etc.). The subtraction of `1` correctly aligns these two if the calendar reports Sunday as 1 and the `shortWeekdaySymbols` array starts with Sunday at index 0. This alignment is standard for many locales like `en_US`.

### 4. `startOfWeek` Static Method

-   **What it does**:
    Calculates and returns the `Date` corresponding to the first day of the week that contains the given input `date`. The specific day considered the "first day of the week" (e.g., Sunday or Monday) depends on the `calendar` instance's `firstWeekday` property, which is often influenced by the user's locale settings.

-   **Code**:
    ```swift
    static func startOfWeek(for date: Date) -> Date {
        calendar.date(from: calendar.dateComponents([.yearForWeekOfYear, .weekOfYear], from: date))!
    }
    ```

-   **How It Works**:
    -   `calendar.dateComponents([.yearForWeekOfYear, .weekOfYear], from: date)`
        -   This part extracts two specific components from the input `date` using the provided `calendar` instance:
            -   `.yearForWeekOfYear`: The year to which the week number belongs. This is important for weeks that span across the boundary of a new year (e.g., the last week of December might partially be in the new year, or vice-versa).
            -   `.weekOfYear`: The ordinal number of the week within that specific year (e.g., 1 through 52 or 53).
        -   Example: If `date` is May 29, 2025 (a Thursday), and using a Gregorian calendar:
            -   `yearForWeekOfYear` would be `2025`.
            -   `weekOfYear` would be `22` (since May 29, 2025 falls into the 22nd week of that year).

    -   `calendar.date(from: ...)`
        -   This function takes the `DateComponents` (which now only contain `yearForWeekOfYear` and `weekOfYear`) and attempts to reconstruct a full `Date` object from them.
        -   When provided with only these week-based components, the `Calendar` interprets this as a request for the *start* of that specified week. The actual day (e.g., Sunday, Monday) that represents the start of the week is determined by the `calendar.firstWeekday` property (e.g., 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.).

    -   Force unwrapping (`!`)
        -   The `calendar.date(from:)` method returns an optional `Date?` because it's possible to provide `DateComponents` that don't form a valid date (e.g., month 13).
        -   In this specific scenario, because the `DateComponents` are derived directly from an existing, valid `date` by requesting its `.yearForWeekOfYear` and `.weekOfYear`, these components will always constitute a valid representation of a week. Therefore, `calendar.date(from:)` is expected to always successfully return a `Date`. The force unwrap (`!`) is used based on this assertion that the operation will not result in `nil`.

-   **Key Insights**:
    -   **Calendar Dependency**: The result is highly dependent on the `calendar` instance used, particularly its `firstWeekday` setting and its system (e.g., Gregorian, Islamic).
    -   **Locale Influence**: The `firstWeekday` is often determined by the user's current locale settings, meaning the "start of the week" can vary for different users.
    -   **Safety of Force Unwrap**: While force unwrapping is generally discouraged, it's considered safe here because the components used to reconstruct the date are directly and validly obtained from an existing date. A failure would imply a fundamental issue with the `Calendar` system or the input `date`'s integrity.
    -   **Time Components**: The resulting `Date` will typically be at the very beginning of that day (i.e., time components like hour, minute, second will be zeroed out or set to the start of the day according to the calendar and time zone).

### 5. `generateFullWeeksCovering` Static Method

  - **What it does**:
    Creates an array of `Date` objects that spans full weeks. The range starts from the first day of the week containing `startDate` and ends on the last day of the week containing `endDate`, ensuring all days within these bounding full weeks are included.

  - **Code**:

    ```swift
    static func generateFullWeeksCovering(from startDate: Date, to endDate: Date) -> [Date] {
        guard startDate <= endDate else { return [] }

        let startOfWeek = startOfWeek(for: startDate) (for:)
        let endOfWeek = endOfWeek(for: endDate)

        var dates = [Date]()
        var currentDate = startOfWeek

        while currentDate <= endOfWeek {
            dates.append(currentDate)
            guard let nextDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: currentDate) else {
                break // Should not happen with valid dates
            }
            currentDate = nextDate
        }

        return dates
    }
    ```

  - **Breakdown**:
    | Component                                                                                                | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
    | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `guard startDate <= endDate else { return [] }`                                                          | Ensures that the `startDate` is not after the `endDate`. If it is, an empty array is returned immediately, as a valid range cannot be formed.                                                                                                         |
    | `let startOfWeek = startOfWeek(for: startDate)`                                                          | Calculates the first day of the week (e.g., Sunday or Monday, depending on `calendar` settings and the `startOfWeek(for:)` implementation) that contains the input `startDate`.                                                                      |
    | `let endOfWeek = endOfWeek(for: endDate)`                                                                | Calculates the last day of the week (e.g., Saturday or Sunday, depending on `calendar` settings and the `endOfWeek(for:)` implementation) that contains the input `endDate`.                                                                          |
    | `var dates = [Date]()`                                                                                   | Initializes an empty mutable array named `dates` that will store the `Date` objects of the generated range.                                                                                                                                           |
    | `var currentDate = startOfWeek`                                                                          | Initializes a variable `currentDate` with `startOfWeek`. This `currentDate` will iterate from the beginning of the week containing `startDate`.                                                                                                       |
    | `while currentDate <= endOfWeek { ... }`                                                                 | A loop that continues as long as `currentDate` is less than or equal to `endOfWeek` (the last day of the week containing `endDate`).                                                                                                                   |
    | `dates.append(currentDate)`                                                                              | Adds the `currentDate` to the `dates` array.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | `guard let nextDate = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: 1, to: currentDate) else { break }`           | Calculates the day immediately following `currentDate` using an accessible `calendar` instance. If this calculation fails (which is highly unlikely for valid dates and calendar operations), the loop is terminated to prevent errors.                |
    | `currentDate = nextDate`                                                                                 | Updates `currentDate` to be the `nextDate` for the subsequent iteration of the loop.                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | `return dates`                                                                                           | Returns the array populated with all dates from `startOfWeek` (the first day of the week containing `startDate`) to `endOfWeek` (the last day of the week containing `endDate`), inclusive.                                                        |

  - **Key Insights**:

      - **Order**: The returned array `dates` contains `Date` objects in chronological order, starting from the first day of the week of the `startDate` and ending with the last day of the week of the `endDate`.
      - **Range Coverage**: The function guarantees that the output array covers full weeks. This means it will always start on the first day of a week and end on the last day of a week, potentially including dates before the provided `startDate` (if `startDate` isn't the first day of its week) and after the `endDate` (if `endDate` isn't the last day of its week) to complete those boundary weeks.
      - **Calendar Dependency**: Relies heavily on an accessible `calendar` object (for adding days) and the behavior of helper functions `startOfWeek(for:)` and `endOfWeek(for:)`. These helpers, in turn, depend on the `calendar`'s settings (e.g., `firstWeekday`, locale) to determine the actual start and end days of a week.
      - **Edge Cases**:
          - If `startDate` is later than `endDate`, an empty array `[]` is returned.
          - If `startDate` and `endDate` are the same, the array will contain all days (e.g., 7 days) of the single week that includes this date.
          - If `startDate` and `endDate` fall within the same week, the array will similarly contain all days of that single week.
          - The `guard let nextDate = ...` provides robustness against potential (though rare) failures in date calculation.

### 6. `action` closure parameter
- **Type Requirement**:
	- `DayCompletionView` expects `action: () -> Void` (no parameters, no return):
		```swift
		struct DayCompletionView: View {
			let action: () -> Void
		}
    
    - But `toggleCompletion(for:)` requires a `Date` parameter and uses the `modelContext`:
		```swift
		func toggleCompletion(for date: Date) {
			let log = habit.log(for: date, modelContext: modelContext)
			log.isCompleted.toggle()
		}

- **How It Works**:
	The closure captures the current `weekDay` value from the `ForEach` iteration
    Creates a parameter-less closure that "remembers" its specific `day`

- **Execution Flow**:
	`Button Tap` â†’ Calls closure `()` â†’ Runs `toggleCompletion(for: capturedDay)`

- **Equivalent Swift Code**:
	```swift
	let action: () -> Void = { [day] in
    	self.toggleCompletion(for: day)
    }
